# Legged Robotics Group `.github` repo

This repository complies with the GitHub framework to standardize the organization's landing page, code of conduct, license, issues, and pull requests (PR) for every other repository under this organization. 
In case the repository does not have a `.github` folder, this one is applied as the default setting. Please keep in mind that there are default settings and your repository might need a specific definition according
to your workflow and tools. Best practice guidelines and language-specific checking are to be defined, probably somewhere else (_not this repo, keep it clean!_).

Suggested future settings here: 
- Folder `./workflows` (CI/CT) for ROS, and PlatformIO (or any other framework/toolchain you work with);
- Autogenerated public repos list with descriptions, as present in [Robotology](https://github.com/robotology);
- [CODEOWNERS file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners).
